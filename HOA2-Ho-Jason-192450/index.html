          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>
            I started off as a non-technical founder for three startups I
            cofounded in my sophomore year of college. Afterwards, I decided to
            become technical and helped other startups with <b>business</b> and
            <b>product</b> while I was learning how to code. After learning how
            to code and build software, I then started working in
            <b>software engineering</b>. Currently, I am a software engineer at
            a venture studio called Kaya Founders.

          <p>
            When I have free time, I like to spend a lot of my time learning
            about startups - I read books, listen to podcasts, and watch talks
            from founders who have already established themselves as successful
            startup founders. I also enjoy listening to music and watching shows
            on
            <i>Netflix</i>.
