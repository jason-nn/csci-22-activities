        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>
          I started off as a non-technical founder for three startups I
          cofounded in my sophomore year of college. Afterwards, I decided to
          become technical and helped other startups with <b>business</b> and
          <b>product</b> while I was learning how to code. After learning how to
          code and build software, I then started working in
          <b>software engineering</b>. Currently, I am a software engineer at a
          venture studio called Kaya Founders.

        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>
          When I have free time, I like to spend a lot of my time learning about
          startups - I read books, listen to podcasts, and watch talks from
          founders who have already established themselves as successful startup
          founders. I also enjoy listening to music and watching shows on
          <i>Netflix</i>.
