          My favorite place is the <i>Ateneo de Manila</i> campus, where I have
          my onsite classes.

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
          The <i>Ateneo de Manila</i> campus is my favorite place because I find
          it very relaxing to walk around the campus and appreciate the
          architecture of the buildings and the natural beauty of the greenery
          after classes end. It's also nice that the campus is so big and some
          buildings are far from each other, because then I have to walk a lot
          which is good exercise. Running to get to my next class when I have
          consecutive classes is also great exercise, but is something I enjoy
          slightly less.
