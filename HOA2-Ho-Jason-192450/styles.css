    I certify that this submission complies with the DISCS Academic 
    Integrity Policy.

    If I have discussed my CSS code with anyone other than
    my instructor(s), my groupmate(s), the teaching assistant(s),
    the extent of each discussion has been clearly noted along with a
    proper citation in the comments of my program.

    If any CSS code or documentation used in my program was obtained 
    from another source, either modified or unmodified, such as a textbook, 
    website, or another individual, the extent of its use has been clearly 
    noted along with a proper citation in the comments of my program.
