        <h2>Why choose grubfood</h2>
        <h3>More variety</h3>
        <p>
          Because we bully our partner restaurants into signing exclusive deals
          with us by threatening to remove them from our platform with trillions
          of daily users, grubfood has more variety than any of its competitors
          by a landslide. Explore our restaurants and find your new favorites!
        </p>
        <h3>Cheaper</h3>
        <p>
          You deliveries are subsidized by the VCs backing us! Even if we burn
          more and more money each year, our growth rises at the same rate so
          investors are happy. Deals on grubfood are so good that sometimes we
          even pay you to get food delivered!
